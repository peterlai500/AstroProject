The morphology and dynamics of a disk encode information about its history, as well as that of any exoplanets within the system. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to obtain 1.3 mm observations of the debris disk around the nearby F5V star HD 170773. We image the face-on ring and determine its fundamental parameters by forward-modeling the interferometric visibilities through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. Using a symmetric Gaussian surface density profile, we find a 71 ± 4 au wide belt with a radius of {193}&lt;SUB&gt;-3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;+2&lt;/SUP&gt; au, a relatively large radius compared with most other millimeter-resolved belts around late A/early F type stars. This makes HD 170773 part of a group of four disks around A and F stars with radii larger than expected from the recently reported planetesimal belt radius—stellar luminosity relation. Two of these systems are known to host directly imaged giant planets, which may point to a connection between large belts and the presence of long-period giant planets. We also set upper limits on the presence of CO and CN gas in the system, which imply that the exocomets that constitute this belt have CO and HCN ice mass fractions of &amp;lt;77% and &amp;lt;3%, respectively. This is consistent with solar system comets and other exocometary belts. Only 20 per cent of old field stars have detectable debris discs, leaving open the question of what disc, if any, is present around the remaining 80 per cent. Young moving groups allow to probe this population, since discs are expected to have been brighter early on. This paper considers the population of F stars in the 23 Myr-old β Pictoris moving group (BPMG) where we find that 9/12 targets possess discs. We also analyse archival ALMA data to derive radii for four of the discs, presenting the first image of the 63 au radius disc of HD 164249. Comparing the BPMG results to disc samples from ∼45-Myr and ∼150-Myr-old moving groups, and to discs found around field stars, we find that the disc incidence rate in young moving groups is comparable to that of the BPMG and significantly higher than that of field stars. The BPMG discs tend to be smaller than those around field stars. However, this difference is not statistically significant due to the small number of targets. Yet, by analysing the fractional luminosity versus disc radius parameter space, we find that the fractional luminosities in the populations considered drop by two orders of magnitude within the first 100 Myr. This is much faster than expected by collisional evolution, implying a decay equivalent to 1/age&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;. We attribute this depletion to embedded planets, which would be around 170 M&lt;SUB&gt;earth&lt;/SUB&gt; to cause a depletion on the appropriate time-scale. However, we cannot rule out that different birth environments of nearby young clusters result in brighter debris discs than the progenitors of field stars that likely formed in a more dense environment.</td><td>2019</td><td>Locating planetesimal belts is fundamental to understand their formation and evolution. We propose REASONS (REsolved ALMA Survey of Nearby Stars) to accurately measure the radius and geometry for 18 nearby planetesimal belts, completing the mm-flux-limited sample of the SONS JCMT Legacy Survey. We will study our newly discovered tentative correlation between belt radius and stellar luminosity, which already suggests a link to the CO snow line location in progenitor protoplanetary disks. If confirmed at high significance through REASONS, this would provide strong evidence for a common belt formation mechanism. By putting together a complete sample of all mm-bright debris disks, we will also provide a crucial test of the population synthesis models that fit the observed population of IR excesses. Additionally, we will search for exocometary gas and compare resolved disks with scattered light images, to constrain the ice content of exocomets and link it back to the belt formation location. This community effort will provide a legacy of all mm-bright resolved debris disks, fundamental for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetesimal belts, including our own.</td><td>HD182681_a_06_TM1</td><td>Marino, Sebastian; Dent, Bill; Milli, Julien; Lawler, Samantha; Absil, Olivier; Augereau, Jean-Charles; Holland, Wayne; Draper, Zachary; del Burgo, Carlos; Davies, Claire; Greaves, Jane; Booth, Mark; Lestrade, Jean-Francois; Carpenter, John; Marshall, Jonathan; Ertel, Steve; Wyatt, Mark; Schieven, Gerald; Matthews, Brenda; Kennedy, Grant; Wahhaj, Zahed; MacGregor, Meredith; Wilner, David;</td><td>0.8664953914454925</td><td>0.02777847291961636</td><td>1.6692911</td><td>uid://A001/X1289/X44f</td><td>uid://A001/X1289/X450</td><td>uid://A002/Xce3de5/X6203</td><td>REsolved ALMA Survey Of Nearby Stars (REASONS): a population study of the formation location of planetesimal belts</td><td>S</td><td>TARGET</td><td>T</td><td>10.484387225517105</td><td>T</td><td>2019ApJ...881...84S 2021MNRAS.502.5390P</td><td>Debris disks</td><td>Disks and planet formation</td><td>2022-12-14T18:33:50.278</td></tr>\n",

The morphology and dynamics of a disk encode information about its history, as well as that of any exoplanets within the system. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to obtain 1.3 mm observations of the debris disk around the nearby F5V star HD 170773. We image the face-on ring and determine its fundamental parameters by forward-modeling the interferometric visibilities through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. Using a symmetric Gaussian surface density profile, we find a 71 ± 4 au wide belt with a radius of {193}&lt;SUB&gt;-3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;+2&lt;/SUP&gt; au, a relatively large radius compared with most other millimeter-resolved belts around late A/early F type stars. This makes HD 170773 part of a group of four disks around A and F stars with radii larger than expected from the recently reported planetesimal belt radius—stellar luminosity relation. Two of these systems are known to host directly imaged giant planets, which may point to a connection between large belts and the presence of long-period giant planets. We also set upper limits on the presence of CO and CN gas in the system, which imply that the exocomets that constitute this belt have CO and HCN ice mass fractions of &amp;lt;77% and &amp;lt;3%, respectively. This is consistent with solar system comets and other exocometary belts. Only 20 per cent of old field stars have detectable debris discs, leaving open the question of what disc, if any, is present around the remaining 80 per cent. Young moving groups allow to probe this population, since discs are expected to have been brighter early on. This paper considers the population of F stars in the 23 Myr-old β Pictoris moving group (BPMG) where we find that 9/12 targets possess discs. We also analyse archival ALMA data to derive radii for four of the discs, presenting the first image of the 63 au radius disc of HD 164249. Comparing the BPMG results to disc samples from ∼45-Myr and ∼150-Myr-old moving groups, and to discs found around field stars, we find that the disc incidence rate in young moving groups is comparable to that of the BPMG and significantly higher than that of field stars. The BPMG discs tend to be smaller than those around field stars. However, this difference is not statistically significant due to the small number of targets. Yet, by analysing the fractional luminosity versus disc radius parameter space, we find that the fractional luminosities in the populations considered drop by two orders of magnitude within the first 100 Myr. This is much faster than expected by collisional evolution, implying a decay equivalent to 1/age&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;. We attribute this depletion to embedded planets, which would be around 170 M&lt;SUB&gt;earth&lt;/SUB&gt; to cause a depletion on the appropriate time-scale. However, we cannot rule out that different birth environments of nearby young clusters result in brighter debris discs than the progenitors of field stars that likely formed in a more dense environment.</td><td>2019</td><td>Locating planetesimal belts is fundamental to understand their formation and evolution. We propose REASONS (REsolved ALMA Survey of Nearby Stars) to accurately measure the radius and geometry for 18 nearby planetesimal belts, completing the mm-flux-limited sample of the SONS JCMT Legacy Survey. We will study our newly discovered tentative correlation between belt radius and stellar luminosity, which already suggests a link to the CO snow line location in progenitor protoplanetary disks. If confirmed at high significance through REASONS, this would provide strong evidence for a common belt formation mechanism. By putting together a complete sample of all mm-bright debris disks, we will also provide a crucial test of the population synthesis models that fit the observed population of IR excesses. Additionally, we will search for exocometary gas and compare resolved disks with scattered light images, to constrain the ice content of exocomets and link it back to the belt formation location.
