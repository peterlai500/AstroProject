Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &amp;#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.</td><td>2016</td><td>Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.</td><td>SgrA_sta_a_09_7M</td><td>Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;</td><td>73.07026135862252</td><td>3.965859607438361</td><td>0.66</td><td>uid://A001/X122/X406</td><td>uid://A001/X122/X409</td><td>uid://A002/Xa2ce2e/X237</td><td>Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole</td><td>S</td><td>BANDPASS</td><td>F</td><td>10.444641829310457</td><td>T</td><td>2016A&amp;A...593A.107L</td><td>Galactic centres/nuclei</td><td>Active galaxies</td><td>2022-12-14T18:33:50.278</td></tr>\n",

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &amp;#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &amp;#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.</td><td>2016</td><td>Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &amp;#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time.

We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &amp;#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.</td><td>2016</td><td>Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.</td><td>SgrA_sta_a_09_TE</td><td>Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;</td><td>8.423616099922379</td><td>0.4652787878964169</td><td>0.52833444</td><td>uid://A001/X122/X406</td><td>uid://A001/X122/X407</td><td>uid://A002/Xb0e56c/X1f64</td><td>Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole</td><td>S</td><td>BANDPASS FLUX WVR</td><td>F</td><td>2.0679007743672866</td><td>T</td><td>2016A&amp;A...593A.107L</td><td>Galactic centres/nuclei</td><td>Active galaxies</td><td>2022-12-14T18:33:50.278</td></tr>\n",

C.; Martín, Sergio; Falcke, Heino; Matsushita, Satoki; Martí-Vidal, Ivan</td><td>Aims: Our aim is to characterize the polarized continuum emission properties including intensity, polarization position angle, and polarization percentage of Sgr A* at ~100 (3.0 mm), ~230 (1.3 mm), ~345 (0.87 mm), ~500 (0.6 mm), and ~700 GHz (0.43 mm). Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &amp;#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.</td><td>2016</td><td>Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.</td><td>SgrA_sta_a_09_7M</td><td>Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;</td><td>77.3547761872716</td><td>3.965859607438361</td><td>0.66</td><td>uid://A001/X122/X406</td><td>uid://A001/X122/X409</td><td>uid://A002/Xa2ce2e/X237</td><td>Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole</td><td>S</td><td>BANDPASS</td><td>F</td><td>10.444641829310457</td><td>T</td><td>2016A&amp;A...593A.107L</td><td>Galactic centres/nuclei</td><td>Active galaxies</td><td>2022-12-14T18:33:50.278</td></tr>\n",
